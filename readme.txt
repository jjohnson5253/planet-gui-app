This app uses the PyQt4 package in python to use a C++ wrapper of the QT API.  The app has a main window that displays information about the 8 different planets and pluto in our solar system.  It pulls that information from a planet class (written in planets.py), so that I could practice inheritance in python.  The app also displays images of each planet.

There is also a dialog window that can be opened which allows user input of number of days and then tells you how many times each planet has orbitted the sun based off the user input.

The main application is written in app.py, the main widget (information about planets) is written in widgets.py, and the dialog is written in dialogs.py

This app was a test to try out some different uses of QT graphics programming.

To run the app, run the app.py script.
